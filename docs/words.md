| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  
| --- | --- | --- | ---  | 
| Feaking all week | reeking of the gun running | Politicians that speak | have out done the un-dunning | 
| Lyrics are Street | if my Uzzi weighs a tonne | Hysterics are beat | word phraser set to stun | 
| Nerdy geeks, seeking peaks | having fun and out-gunning |  Discussing how leaks are  | steep and out-doneing and you're  | 
| wetting  your  beak  | drinking wine  and making  money  | and just smoking , some weed | all the  time , by the tonny  | 
| smoking some weed | all the time by the tonny | taking a toke  | thinking everythings funny	 | 
| joking around  | and blowing my money on | shit that I smoke   |  all the time by the tonny	 | 
| Creaping  up , sleak man | unsung and  un-humming | Along to the beats man | its stunning  | 
| but meeks seeking freaks | it kinda sounds funny | 	if your'e running all week  | you'll seek and find honey | 	
| Cut out your shit | coz the shit aint cunning | I call it shit | coz your shit is bumming | 
| Winging and stringing | the  tracks to the stars wax | Maxing tax pinging the jar | get in the car max | 
| smoking some weed | all the time by the tonny | taking a toke  | thinking everythings funny	 | 
| joking around  | and blowing my money on | shit that I smoke   |  all the time by the tonny	 | 
| 99 get smart bringing  the control or | caos. 	| Bringing the  sounds and the | beats  that go wayoff | 
| Stacking  the pounds| in pyramids like madoff | Working to the beats  | was the job, you got laid off |	
| Racking the mind | to the lid with your hat off | Kick off the tale | hit the hammer with  the nail of |
| Knock off sale  | get caught  and  go to jail | Walls in mexico are | ones that ill scale off |
| Run off jack |  or jackoff another male | 	Sell off crack |  like the shit was on sale |
| 13 rules ,for| radicals and fools  | 	Tools for revolution | starting in our schools | 
| Whatchya want  , whatchya | need and what your gonna get | 	You sow what  you seed | and never forget.	|
| Take a look at author | Saul D Alinsky | Books are more than paper | they  are history |
| ... Its the beat in the loop | thats got to suit | The kick, the snare | the base in a fat soup |
| If theres  a fire in the | kitchen, scoot | it's what I said |  that ignites the loop |
| Number one  | Power is not only what you have.	..| but what the enemy |  thinks you have , sav?  | 	
| ... they won |  if you dont understand | .	Perception is a reality |   controlled by invisible hands. |	
| Understand | or are we good man | 	Gripping sanity man | is all that I can |
Sit in awe, look at it raw, with all its flaws.	Shit i saw, and then I draw out the divine.	
The line, the law, and where I pull out my claws.	Sux harder than when you're doing it thru a straw.	
Ha Ha, The score they gave, got have it.	Ha Ha,  Says it all, the flave,yo, silly rabbit.	
Next, What for? they rave, got to grab it.	Ha Ha, No more giveaways, you got nab it.	
If the beat is a murder, then I just got to stab it.	With murmurs of words that make it more elaborate.	
... its the crack in your shell, and I can tell.	Might as well, keep paving the roads to hell.	
With good intentions, and all that you hold.	pick a side when you hit the fork in the road.	
Number one , Power is not only what you have.	.. but what the enemy thinks you have , sav? 	
... they won , if you dont understand.	Perception is a reality,  controlled by invisible hands.

Be all prepared for the lessons to come.	Gipping heat, nothing short of a hazard, massive.	
Attack, bringing it back, be second to none.	Dropping beats and thoughts and mad fun.	
It was something you ate, not something you hate.	Wait, is this something to rate or more like a state.	
Something great, and more like a trait.	Setting straight before it gets to late to create.	
		
Eat what's on the plate, wipe it clean like a slate.	No second date, or loot crate, so why bother	
Just a gate to your fate, a fish to your bait. 	A wish you cant escape, until it's too late rather	
Catch up mate, no hesitate, get higher	No need to debate, it's rude to berate, liar	
Life's state, to awake not tire	shake it off smooth, i dont want no deniers, who hate	
		
take it off the groove, and my record crate, Brother	wake her to the mood, I dont want to debate	
faking it too, because im coming to late	making it blue, shoot, ejaculate fire	
hating a fool, must be a foolish state, Brother	i dont make the rules, I dont confiscate,  either	
it dont make you cool, if you have to speak louder	am i the fool, if invention's  is the mother	
da mother, da mother, the sounds from the under ground	bound to one another, the sounds that the record found	
crate diggers digging beats that loop good	go figure,I know that you would	
id rather, I rather, get started, try harder	another, or rather, departed, fly lauder	
1st class is too dear, I fear that I only	travel business class without being a foney	
Steganography, is not a word hater	Liberator Pistol, has got to to be sold	
Hold and strcatch the megafone	40 track mode, load up on the gold	
Source Code, Go get Grawlix	Fix, the point on the asterix, or get a fix	
it clicks with my click, even though im really old	I burn the candle wix, that you sold, coz im bold	
sticks and stones, buillt into my mold	thow it like you wish, it cant break my bones.	
		
		
this is the shit that i say	when i wait for the beat to play	ace
queue up my words,	and add some delay	place
the bass decays	take control if i may	race
racking trolls	makes my day	grace
staking goals	finding ways	brace
hacking nodes	and all those war games	pace
bashing codes	wrapping frames	lace
stick to night mode	the defaults lame	face
