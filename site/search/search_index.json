Bringing the sounds and the beats that go wayoff Stacking the pounds in pyramids like madoff Working to the beats was the job, you got laid off Racking the mind to the lid with your hat off Kick off the tale hit the hammer with the nail of Knock off sale get caught and go to jail Walls in mexico are ones that ill scale off Run off jack or jackoff another male Sell off crack like the shit was on sale 13 rules ,for radicals and fools Tools for revolution starting in our schools Whatchya want , whatchya need and what your gonna get You sow what you seed and never forget. Take a look at author Saul D Alinsky Books are more than paper they are history ... Its the beat in the loop thats got to suit The kick, the snare the base in a fat soup If theres a fire in the kitchen, scoot it's what I said that ignites the loop Number one Power is not only what you have. .. but what the enemy thinks you have , sav? ... they won if you dont understand . Perception is a reality controlled by invisible hands. Understand or are we good man Gripping sanity man is all that I can Sit in awe, look at it raw, with all its flaws. Shit i saw, and then I draw out the divine. The line, the law, and where I pull out my claws. Sux harder than when you're doing it thru a straw. Ha Ha, The score they gave, got have it. Ha Ha, Says it all, the flave,yo, silly rabbit. Next, What for? they rave, got to grab it. Ha Ha, No more giveaways, you got nab it. If the beat is a murder, then I just got to stab it. With murmurs of words that make it more elaborate. ... its the crack in your shell, and I can tell. Might as well, keep paving the roads to hell. With good intentions, and all that you hold. pick a side when you hit the fork in the road. Number one , Power is not only what you have. .. but what the enemy thinks you have , sav? ... they won , if you dont understand. Perception is a reality, controlled by invisible hands. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BonLjz45Mt8&list=PLPd7X2DxHoHCILaJMGRfj-g-FDM7bM2DG&index=3 Be all prepared for the lessons to come. Gipping heat, nothing short of a hazard, massive. Attack, bringing it back, be second to none. Dropping beats and thoughts and mad fun. It was something you ate, not something you hate. Wait, is this something to rate or more like a state. Something great, and more like a trait. Setting straight before it gets to late to create. Eat what's on the plate, wipe it clean like a slate. No second date, or loot crate, so why bother Just a gate to your fate, a fish to your bait.
